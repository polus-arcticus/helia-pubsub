## Getting Started

This project is a template to be used to pull a given example from a folder/directory of another repository.

### Requirements

- Add descriptions to the example (mandatory)
- Check if the github action to perform the pull from another repository exists.
- Turn off issue/wikis/projects/discussions
- Disable Releases/Environments/Packages
- Create a PR against [Helia Examples](https://github.com/ipfs-examples/helia-examples) with your new example in a directory under `./examples` that matches the name of this repo
